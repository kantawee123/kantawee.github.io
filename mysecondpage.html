        <h1 class="book_name">Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C</h1>
        <h2 class="writer_name">By Bruce Schneier</h2>
        <p>This second edition of the cryptography classic provides you with a comprehensive survey of modern cryptography. The book details how programmers and electronic communications professionals can use cryptography -- the technique of enciphering and deciphering messages -- to maintain the privacy of computer data. It describes dozens of cryptography algorithms, gives practical advice on how to implement them in cryptographic software, and shows how they can be used to solve security problems. Covering the latest developments in practical cryptographic techniques, this new edition shows programmers who design computer applications, networks, and storage systems how they can build security into their software and systems.</p>
